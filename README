This is the README file for Module::Load, a perl module for simple
laoding of modules in a DWIM-style.

Please refer to 'perldoc Module::Load' after installation for details.


Module::Load follows the standard perl module install process;

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

The module uses no C or XS parts, so no c-compiler is required.
